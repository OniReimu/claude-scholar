# Field-Specific Language and Terminology

## Overview

Adapt language, terminology, and conventions to match the specific scientific discipline. Each field has established vocabulary, preferred phrasings, and domain-specific conventions that signal expertise and ensure clarity for the target audience.

## Identifying Field-Specific Linguistic Conventions

**Before writing, review:**
- Recent high-impact papers in the target journal
- Field-specific abbreviations, units, and notation systems
- Preferred terms (e.g., "participants" vs. "subjects," "compound" vs. "drug")
- How methods, organisms, or techniques are typically described

## Biomedical and Clinical Sciences

**Key conventions:**
- Use precise anatomical and clinical terminology (e.g., "myocardial infarction" not "heart attack")
- Follow standardized disease nomenclature (ICD, DSM, SNOMED-CT)
- Specify drug names using generic names first, brand names in parentheses if needed
- Use "patients" for clinical studies, "participants" for community-based research
- Follow HGVS nomenclature for genetic variants
- Report lab values with SI units

**Common terminology:**
- "myocardial infarction" (not "heart attack")
- "cerebrovascular accident" or "stroke" (context-dependent)
- "hypertension" (not "high blood pressure" in formal writing)

## Molecular Biology and Genetics

**Gene/protein notation:**
- Use italics for gene symbols (e.g., *TP53*), regular font for proteins (e.g., p53)
- Species-specific: uppercase for human (*BRCA1*), sentence case for mouse (*Brca1*)
- Standard genetic notation: +/+, +/-, -/- for genotypes

**Organism naming:**
- Specify full names at first mention, then accepted abbreviations (e.g., *Escherichia coli*, then *E. coli*)
- Italicize organism names (binomial nomenclature)

**Molecular techniques:**
- "quantitative PCR" or "qPCR" (not "real-time PCR")
- "Western blot" (not "immunoblot" unless specifying method)

## Chemistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences

**Nomenclature:**
- Follow IUPAC nomenclature for chemical compounds
- Use systematic names for novel compounds, common names for well-known substances
- Specify chemical structures using standard notation (SMILES, InChI for databases)

**Units and concentrations:**
- Report with appropriate units: mM, μM, nM, or % w/v, v/v
- Describe synthesis routes using accepted reaction nomenclature

**Common terms:**
- "bioavailability," "pharmacokinetics," "IC50" (consistent with field definitions)

## Ecology and Environmental Sciences

**Species notation:**
- Use binomial nomenclature (italicized: *Homo sapiens*)
- Specify taxonomic authorities at first species mention when relevant

**Habitat and metrics:**
- Employ standardized habitat and ecosystem classifications
- Use consistent terminology: "species richness," "Shannon diversity index"

**Sampling methods:**
- "transect," "quadrat," "mark-recapture"

## Physics and Engineering

**Units and notation:**
- Follow SI units consistently unless field conventions dictate otherwise
- Use standard notation: scalars vs. vectors, tensors
- Use mathematical notation consistent with field standards (e.g., ℏ for reduced Planck constant)

**Phenomena and equipment:**
- "quantum entanglement," "laminar flow"
- Specify equipment with model numbers and manufacturers when relevant

## Neuroscience

**Brain nomenclature:**
- Use standardized brain region nomenclature (refer to atlases like Allen Brain Atlas)
- Specify coordinates using established stereotaxic systems

**Neural terminology:**
- "action potential" (not "spike" in formal writing)
- "neural activity," "neuronal firing," "brain activation" (based on measurement method)

**Recording techniques:**
- "whole-cell patch clamp," "extracellular recording"

## Social and Behavioral Sciences

**Person-first language:**
- "people with schizophrenia" (not "schizophrenics")
- Use "participants" rather than "subjects" for human research

**Constructs and measures:**
- Employ standardized psychological constructs and validated assessment names
- Follow APA guidelines for reducing bias in language
- Specify theoretical frameworks using established terminology

## General Principles

### Match Audience Expertise

**Specialized journals:** Use field-specific terminology freely, define only highly specialized or novel terms

**Broad-impact journals (*Nature*, *Science*):** Define more technical terms, provide context for specialized concepts

**Interdisciplinary audiences:** Balance precision with accessibility, define terms at first use

### Define Technical Terms Strategically

- Define abbreviations at first use: "messenger RNA (mRNA)"
- Provide brief explanations for specialized techniques when writing for broader audiences
- Avoid over-defining terms well-known to the target audience
- Create a glossary if numerous specialized terms are unavoidable

### Maintain Consistency

- Use the same term for the same concept throughout
- Follow a consistent system for abbreviations
- Apply the same nomenclature system throughout (especially for genes, species, chemicals)

### Avoid Field Mixing Errors

- Don't use clinical terminology for basic science (e.g., don't call mice "patients")
- Avoid colloquialisms or overly general terms in place of precise field terminology
- Don't import terminology from adjacent fields without ensuring proper usage

### Verify Terminology Usage

- Consult field-specific style guides and nomenclature resources
- Check how terms are used in recent papers from the target journal
- Use domain-specific databases and ontologies (Gene Ontology, MeSH terms)
- When uncertain, cite a key reference that establishes terminology
