- Figures and tables
- Supplementary information (methods, additional data)
- Competing interests statement
- Author contribution statement

**Peer review**:
- Typically 2-4 months

- Author response opportunity
- Revisions often required

**Acceptance rate**: Approximately 8% for Nature

## Other High-Impact Journals

### Science

**Requirements**:
- Articles: Up to 4500 words
- Reports: Up to 2500 words
- 5-6 display items
- Methods in supplementary or integrated

**Editorial criteria**:
- Broad significance beyond specific field
- Novelty and conceptual advance
- Technical excellence

### PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)

**Requirements**:
- Direct submissions: 6 pages + references
- Contributed by Academy member: different limits
- Methods can be supplementary

**Tracks**:
- Direct submission (any researcher)
- Communicated by Academy member
- Contributed by Academy member

### Cell

**Requirements**:
- Research Articles: Variable length
- Reports: Shorter format
- Methods integrated or supplementary
- Strong emphasis on biological mechanism

## Writing for High-Impact Journals

### Broad Accessibility

**Principles**:
- Write for intelligent non-specialists
- Avoid excessive jargon
- Define technical terms
- Provide context and motivation
- Use clear, narrative structure

**Introduction structure**:
1. Hook: Why is this important broadly?
2. Background: What is known (briefly)?
3. Gap: What don't we know?
4. Approach: What did we do?
5. Advance: What did we discover?

### Abstract Writing

**Nature abstract requirements** (150 words):
- One paragraph, no subheadings
- Clear statement of problem and findings
- Broad significance
- Accessible to non-specialists
- No citations or abbreviations

**Example structure**:
```
Here we show that [finding], which [explains why important].
Our approach [brief method]. The results demonstrate that
[key result] with implications for [broad impact].
These findings advance understanding of [field] and may
lead to [applications].
```

### Significance Statement

Many high-impact journals require a separate significance statement:

```
This work is significant because it [explains the fundamental
advance]. It advances the field by [specific contribution]
and has implications for [broader area]. Unlike previous
studies that [limitation], our approach [novel aspect].
```

### Visual Storytelling

**Figures in high-impact journals**:
- Tell a clear, compelling story
- Self-explanatory with detailed captions
- Publication quality, professional design
- Color schemes accessible to colorblind readers
- Consistent style throughout

**Model figure guidelines**:
- Show overall architecture or model
- Use clear labels and annotations
- Include scale bars where appropriate
- High resolution (300-600 DPI)
- Vector format preferred (PDF, EPS)

### Supplementary Material Strategy

**What to include**:
- Extended methods (all experimental details)
- Additional data (tables, figures)
- Statistical analyses
- Code and algorithms
- Reproducibility information

**Organization**:
- Clearly labeled (Supplementary Figure 1, etc.)
- Referenced in main text
- Compiled into single PDF or separate files
- Limited file size requirements

## Common Reasons for Rejection

**Editorial rejection (without review)**:
1. Lack of broad significance
2. Incremental advance over existing work
3. Inappropriate scope for journal
4. Technical limitations or methodological issues
5. Incomplete or preliminary data

**Post-review rejection**:
1. Insufficient novelty
2. Inadequate experimental support
3. Alternative explanations not addressed
4. Overinterpretation of results
5. Poor reproducibility concerns

## Submission Strategy

### Pre-submission Inquiry

**When to use**:
- Uncertain if paper is appropriate
- Want editorial feedback before full submission
- Nature and some journals offer this option

**What to include**:
- Brief summary (200-300 words)
- List of authors and affiliations
- Statement of significance
- Why this journal

### Cover Letter

**Essential for high-impact journals**:

- Brief justification for each

**Opposed reviewers**:
- People who should not review
- Competitors or those with conflicts

## Revision Process

### Responding to Reviews

**Structure**:

2. Point-by-point responses
3. Summary of major changes
4. Additional experiments/analyses
5. Polite, professional tone

**Response format**:
```
