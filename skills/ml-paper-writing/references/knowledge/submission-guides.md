## Common Submission Requirements

### Double-Blind Review
**Applies to:** NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, COLM

**Requirements:**
- Remove author names and affiliations
- Anonymize citations to own work (use [Anonymous, 2024])
- Remove acknowledgments that reveal identity
- Avoid distinctive phrases that identify authors
- Supplementary materials must also be anonymized

**Common Mistakes:**
- Forgetting to anonymize GitHub links
- Including author names in file paths
- Thanking specific colleagues in acknowledgments
- Citing own work with author names

### Code and Data Availability

**Increasingly Required:**

**NeurIPS:** Encourages code/data availability statements
**ICML:** Encourages reproducibility
**ICLR:** Recommends code sharing

**Best Practices:**
- Include code repository link (anonymized if under review)
- Provide data access instructions
- Describe hyperparameters and settings
- Note any proprietary constraints

### Supplementary Materials

**General Guidelines:**
- Appendices allowed but not required reading
- Use for additional experiments, proofs, tables
- Keep main paper self-contained
- Reference supplementary in main text

**Formatting:**
- Same style as main paper
- Clear section numbering (S1, S2, etc.)
- Include in submission PDF or as separate file

## Citation Styles

### Common Styles in ML

**IEEE Style (Numbered):**
```
[1] J. Doe, "Paper title," Conference Name, Year.
[2] A. Smith, "Another paper," Journal Name, vol. 10, pp. 1-15, 2020.
```

**ACM Style (Numbered):**
```
[J. Doe and A. Smith, "Paper title," Conference Name, Year.
[A. Smith and B. Jones, "Another paper," Journal Name, 2020.
```

**Author-Year (APA-like):**
```
Doe (2020) J. Doe. Paper title. Conference Name.
Smith (2019) A. Smith. Another paper. Journal Name.
```

### Reference Management

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent style throughout
- Include DOIs when available
- Provide arXiv links for preprints
- Check for broken links
- Verify all citations before submission
