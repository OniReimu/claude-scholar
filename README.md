## Core Workflows

### Primary Workflows

Complete academic research lifecycle - 7 stages from idea to publication.

#### 1. Research Ideation

Systematic research startup with idea generation and literature review:

**Tools**: `research-ideation` skill + `literature-reviewer` agent

**Process**:
- **5W1H Brainstorming**: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How → structured thinking framework
- **Literature Review**: arXiv + Semantic Scholar integration → automated paper search and classification
- **Gap Analysis**: 5 types (Literature, Methodological, Application, Interdisciplinary, Temporal) → identify research opportunities
- **Research Question**: SMART principles → formulate specific, measurable questions

**Command**: `/research-init "topic"` → launches complete research startup workflow

#### 2. ML Project Development

Maintainable ML project structure for experiment code:

**Tools**: `architecture-design` skill + `code-reviewer` agent + `git-workflow` skill

**Process**:
- **Structure**: Factory & Registry patterns → config-driven models (only `cfg` parameter) → enforced by `rules/coding-style.md`
- **Code Style**: 200-400 line files → type hints required → `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for configs → max 3-level nesting
- **Debug** (`bug-detective`): Error pattern matching for Python/Bash/JS → stack trace analysis → anti-pattern identification
- **Git**: Conventional Commits (`feat/scope: message`) → branch strategy (master/develop/feature) → merge with `--no-ff`

**Commands**: `/plan`, `/commit`, `/code-review`, `/tdd`

#### 3. Experiment Analysis

Statistical analysis and visualization of experimental results:

**Tools**: `results-analysis` skill + `data-analyst` agent

**Process**:
- **Data Processing**: Automated cleaning and preprocessing of experiment logs
- **Statistical Testing**: t-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon signed-rank → validate significance
- **Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn integration → publication-ready figures (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps)
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic component analysis → understand contribution of each part

**Command**: `/analyze-results <experiment_dir>` → generates analysis report with figures and statistics

#### 4. Paper Writing

Systematic paper writing from template to final draft:

**Tools**: `ml-paper-writing` skill + `paper-miner` agent + `latex-conference-template-organizer` skill

**Process**:
- **Template Preparation**: Download conference .zip → extract main files → remove sample content → clean Overleaf-ready structure
- **Citation Verification** (`citation-verification`): Multi-layer validation (Format → API → Information → Content) → prevents hallucinations
- **Systematic Writing**: Narrative framing → 5-sentence abstract formula → section-by-section drafting with feedback cycles
- **Anti-AI Processing** (`writing-anti-ai`): Remove inflated symbolism, promotional language, vague attributions → add human voice and rhythm → bilingual support (EN/CN)

**Venues**: NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL, AAAI, COLM, Nature, Science, Cell, PNAS

#### 5. Paper Self-Review

Quality assurance before submission:

**Tools**: `paper-self-review` skill

**Process**:
- **Structure Check**: Logical flow, section balance, narrative coherence
- **Logic Validation**: Argument soundness, claim-evidence alignment, assumption clarity
- **Citation Audit**: Reference accuracy, proper attribution, citation completeness
- **Figure Quality**: Visual clarity, caption completeness, color accessibility
- **Writing Polish**: Grammar, clarity, conciseness, academic tone
- **Compliance**: Page limits, formatting requirements, ethical disclosures

**6-item checklist** → systematic quality assessment

#### 6. Submission & Rebuttal

Paper submission and review response:

**Tools**: `review-response` skill + `rebuttal-writer` agent

**Submission Process**:
- **Pre-submission**: Conference-specific checklists (NeurIPS 16-item, ICML Broader Impact, ICLR LLM disclosure)
- **Format Check**: Page limits, anonymization, supplementary materials
- **Final Review**: Proofread, check references, verify figures

**Rebuttal Process**:
- **Review Analysis**: Parse and classify comments (Major/Minor/Typo/Misunderstanding)
- **Response Strategy**: Accept/Defend/Clarify/Experiment → tailored approach per comment type
- **Rebuttal Writing**: Structured response with evidence and reasoning
- **Tone Management**: Professional, respectful, evidence-based language

**Command**: `/rebuttal <review_file>` → generates complete rebuttal document with experiment plan

#### 7. Post-Acceptance Processing

Conference preparation and research promotion:

**Tools**: `post-acceptance` skill

**Process**:
- **Presentation**: Slide creation guidance (15/20/30 min formats) → visual design principles → storytelling structure
- **Poster**: Academic poster templates (A0/A1 sizes) → layout optimization → visual hierarchy
- **Promotion**: Social media content (Twitter/X, LinkedIn) → blog posts → press releases → research summaries

**Commands**: `/presentation`, `/poster`, `/promote` → automated content generation

**Coverage**: 90% of academic research lifecycle (from idea to publication)

### Supporting Workflows

These workflows run in the background to enhance the primary workflows.

#### Automated Enforcement Workflow

Cross-platform hooks (Node.js) automate workflow enforcement:

```
Session Start → Skill Evaluation → Session End → Session Stop
```

- **skill-forced-eval** (`skill-forced-eval.js`): Before EVERY user prompt → dynamically scans all available skills (local + plugins) → forces evaluation of each skill → requires activation before implementation → ensures no relevant skill is missed
- **session-start** (`session-start.js`): Session begins → displays Git status, pending todos, available commands, package manager → shows project context at a glance
- **session-summary** (`session-summary.js`): Session ends → generates comprehensive work log → summarizes all changes made → provides smart recommendations for next steps
- **stop-summary** (`stop-summary.js`): Session stops → quick status check → detects temporary files → shows actionable cleanup suggestions

**Cross-platform**: All hooks use Node.js (not shell scripts) ensuring Windows/macOS/Linux compatibility.

#### Knowledge Extraction Workflow

Two specialized mining agents continuously extract knowledge to improve skills:

- **paper-miner** (agent): Analyze research papers (PDF/DOCX/arXiv links) → extracts writing patterns, structure insights, venue requirements, rebuttal strategies → updates `ml-paper-writing/references/knowledge/` with categorized entries (structure.md, writing-techniques.md, submission-guides.md, review-response.md)
- **kaggle-miner** (agent): Study winning Kaggle competition solutions → extract competition briefs, front-runner detailed technical analysis, code templates, best practices → update the `kaggle-learner` skill's knowledge base (`references/knowledge/[domain]/` directories, categorized by NLP/CV/Time Series/Tabular/Multimodal)

**Knowledge feedback loop**: Each paper or solution analyzed enriches the knowledge base, creating a self-improving system that evolves with your research.

#### Skill Evolution System

3-step continuous improvement cycle for maintaining and improving skills:

```
skill-development → skill-quality-reviewer → skill-improver
```

1. **Develop** (`skill-development`): Create skills with proper YAML frontmatter → clear descriptions with trigger phrases → progressive disclosure (lean SKILL.md, details in `references/`)
2. **Review** (`skill-quality-reviewer`): 4-dimension quality assessment → Description Quality (25%), Content Organization (30%), Writing Style (20%), Structural Integrity (25%) → generates improvement plan with prioritized fixes
3. **Improve** (`skill-improver`): Merges suggested changes → updates documentation → iterates on feedback → reads improvement plans and applies changes automatically
